We imported the CSV file into Power BI and began by transforming the data. Initial data processing included adjusting column formats and handling
various peripheral tasks to make the dataset more editable and analysis-ready.

We then added new columns such as Month and Year. With the data prepared, we proceeded to create visualizations focused on key fields:
Month, Year, Product Name, Units Sold, Revenue, Discount, and Platform.
